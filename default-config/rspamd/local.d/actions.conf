# Action thresholds for spam filtering
# Lower scores = more lenient, Higher scores = more strict
#
# Score progression should be: greylist < add_header < reject
#
# Current settings are lenient for testing/development
# Increase these values for production use
#
# Note: File is named actions.conf, so rspamd already knows these are actions
# Do NOT wrap in actions {} block - that causes "nested section" error

# Reject emails with spam score >= 20 (was ~15 default)
reject = 20;

# Add spam headers at score >= 12 (was ~6 default)
add_header = 12;

# Greylist (soft reject) at score >= 15 (was ~10 default)
# This causes temporary rejection with "try again later"
greylist = 15;
