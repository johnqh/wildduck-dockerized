# Action thresholds for spam filtering
# Lower scores = more lenient, Higher scores = more strict
#
# Score progression should be: greylist < add_header < reject
#
# Current settings are lenient for testing/development
# Increase these values for production use

    # Reject emails with spam score >= 20 (was ~15 default)

    # Greylist (soft reject) at score >= 15 (was ~10 default)
    # This causes temporary rejection with "try again later"
